                <h1>About Me.</h1>
                <p>I live on Lookout Mountain with my husband Aaron and our cat Tuxedo. I enjoy watching Jeopardy!, having wine with my gal pals, and laughing with my family and friends. I think the best part of waking up is truly Folgers in my cup. I'm not a snob about coffee. I'm a snob without it.</p>
                <p>Aside from winning a Computer Award in the 8th grade for making a pretty sweet Powerpoint presentation, I don't have much experience with coding/ technology in general. I am hoping I didn't peak as I am excited to dig into the next 10 weeks with Coding Temple and come out the other side with the tools to make an even sweeter Powerpoint.</p>

                <h1>Why Coding Temple?</h1>
                <p>I took an interest in coding after seeing a few of my friends in college take coding courses. My skills and interests seem to align. I enjoy problem solving, organizing, and detail oriented work. I love seeing a project come together especially after some sweat and tears. I enjoy being challenged and competing with myself which is something I am eager to experience during the next 10 weeks and hopefully after graduating and entering the professional world.</p>

                <h1>Did you know...</h1>
                <strong></small>I was named after the Bruce Horsby song, "Mandolin Rain?"</strong>
                <p> Try to find my name in the verse! 
                    
                    "The song came and went, like the times that we spent, hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent. I laughed and she'd smile; it would last for awhile. You don't know what you got till you lose it all again."

                    Can't find it? That's because my dad misunderstood the song lyrics and thought my name was in there. It is not. So I just tell people I'm named after a mountain.
